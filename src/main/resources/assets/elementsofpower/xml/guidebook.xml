  <section>
    <title>Casting Spells</title>
    <p>A spell is a series of elements. Each element has an effect and shape. The order of the elements matters, as their effects change depending on the position within the spell.</p>
    <p>The first element in the spell defines its primary effect, while subsequent elements will apply modifiers to it.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>The last element in the spell will dictate the shape/casting style of the spell.</p>
    <p>Having multiple of the same element one after the other will increase the primary effect, while opposite elements will reduce or cancel this effect.</p>
    <p>Also, a modifier effect will not be applied if the effect is cancelled by the previous element, but the shape will still apply.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Effects and Shapes</title>
    <p>Fire causes Flames, in the shape of a Sphere around caster.</p>
    <p>Water spawns flowing water, in the shape of a Ball thrown forward.</p>
    <p>Air blows things away, in the shape of a Cone in front of the caster.</p>
    <p>Earth does things, shape not decided yet.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>Light protects and illuminates, the shape is a Beam.</p>
    <p>Darkness weakens and darkens, the shape is not yet determined.</p>
    <p>Life heals and repairs, these spells are Self-cast.</p>
    <p>Death breaks and damages, they take the aspect of Curses.</p>

<chapter id="rings">
  <section>
    <title>Extra Storage</title>
    <p>Gemstones can store elemental essences, but you will have to continuously swap the gemstone in your wands if you rely on that.</p>
    <p>A better way to store extra essences is by crafting a ring.</p>
  </section>
</chapter>
<chapter id="staves">
  <section>
    <title>Improved Casting</title>
    <p>Wands are a perfectly good tool, but they are limited in how much essence they can contain.</p>
    <p>Wands can be upgraded into staves, which will double the effective essence amounts in the gemstone, allowing the caster to reach higher spell tiers.</p>

    <title>Rituals</title>
    <p>You believe there may be some way to perform complex interactions by making use of structures built in the world.</p>
    <p>Sadly, the specifics of the method escape you. Maybe at a later date, it will be possible.</p>
